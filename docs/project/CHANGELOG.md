will be documented here.

This project uses paired naming:
- vóṇōs Emergence Deck (v0.x)
- vóṇōs Canonical Deck (v1.x)

## [1.0.0] — 2026-01-19 — Governance Milestone: Paired Naming + Deck Semantics

### Added
- POLICY.md as canonical governance reference.
- Paired naming model:
  - Emergence Deck (v0.x)
  - Canonical Deck (v1.x)
- Explicit promotion workflow (Emergence → Canonical).
- Gate enforcement posture definition (diagnostic vs binding).
- Template neutrality policy (templates are deck-agnostic).

### Changed
- Terminology shift:
  - v0.1 is now labeled "vóṇōs Emergence Deck (v0.1)"
  - v1.0 is now labeled "vóṇōs Canonical Deck (v1.0)"
- Folder READMEs should display paired naming for browse clarity.

### Notes
- This milestone changes semantics, not the core card structure.
- Content promotion is explicit and requires human approval.
