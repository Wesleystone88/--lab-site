CARD-0 — PACKAGE (Domain Envelope)
Purpose:
Declare what kind of thing this project fundamentally is before intent is defined.
Prevents category confusion and hidden assumption drift.

Contains:
- Project Class
- Execution Mode
- Artifact Types
- Distribution
- Longevity
- Compliance Scope
- Success Horizon

Gate:
PACKAGE must be declared before CARD-1 exists.
