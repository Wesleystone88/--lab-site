PURPOSE
The νόησις Artifact Deck is a portable, human-first framework for converting vague ideas
into durable, explicit, and shareable system specifications. Each card represents a
complete specification artifact — not a summary, not a sketch, not a placeholder.

Cards persist across LLM sessions, model changes, collaborators, and time.
No engine, software, or tooling is required to use this deck.
