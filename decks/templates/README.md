## Templates are deck-agnostic.

### Usage rules:

**Emergence Deck:**
- Partial filling allowed.
- Open questions allowed.
- Gates are diagnostic.

**Canonical Deck:**
- Complete filling required.
- No unresolved placeholders.
- Gates are binding.

Templates must remain neutral and reusable across both decks.
