## What This Is

The **Conversation Grounding Deck** is a set of 13 independent markdown cards designed to prevent AI conversations from drifting, losing focus, or forgetting context.

**Core principle**: Cards are human-owned artifacts that persist across sessions.  
**Philosophy**: Structure without rigidity. Grounding without control.

This is **NOT**:
- A prompt pack
- An automation framework
- A tool-specific integration
- A rigid workflow system

This **IS**:
- A cognitive stabilizer for long conversations
- A persistence layer for human intent
- A lightweight thinking companion
- Copy/paste portable across any LLM interface

## The 13 Cards

### Foundation Cards (Orientation)
1. **CARD-01: Alignment Anchor** — Why this conversation exists
2. **CARD-02: Constraints & Rules** — Boundaries the conversation must respect
3. **CARD-03: Intent & Direction** — What we're aiming at (even if unclear)
4. **CARD-04: Scope & Boundaries** — What's in/out of scope

### Collection Cards (Memory)
5. **CARD-05: Notes & Idea Collection** — Raw thoughts and fragments
6. **CARD-06: Assumptions & Beliefs** — Hidden foundations surfaced
7. **CARD-07: Open Questions** — Unanswered questions tracked
8. **CARD-08: Idea Collection** — Ideas preserved without evaluation

### Decision Cards (Momentum)
9. **CARD-09: Decisions** — What's been decided (with rationale)
10. **CARD-10: Definitions & Terminology** — Shared vocabulary established
11. **CARD-11: Context Handoff** — Session resume package

### Execution Cards (Build)
12. **CARD-12: Progress Tracker** — What's done, what's next
13. **CARD-13: Build Card** — Stepwise execution container

## How to Use

### Starting a Conversation
1. Choose which card(s) matter for your conversation
2. Copy the card file(s) into your chat
3. Fill the "Human-Filled Fields" sections
4. Paste into chat with your query

### During Conversation
- Cards guide the assistant's behavior without rigid enforcement
- Update cards as intent shifts or decisions solidify
- Add new cards when needed

### Resuming After Reset
- Use **CARD-11 (Context Handoff)** to package state
- Paste handoff card into new session
- Conversation resumes with context intact

### Building Something
- Use **CARD-13 (Build Card)** for stepwise execution
- One step per message, no drift, no retro-edits
- Progress reports at each step

## Key Principles

### Exploration Mode
- **No fixed order**: Use cards in any sequence
- **No gates**: Cards don't block each other
- **No completeness requirement**: Partial cards are valid
- **Contradictions allowed**: Thinking happens in real-time

### Human Authority
- Cards are human-owned artifacts
- Assistant cannot override card content
- Assistant behavior follows active cards
- Human may change/remove cards anytime

### Portability
- Pure markdown, no dependencies
- Works in any LLM interface (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Copy/paste workflow only
- No tools, no engines, no frameworks

---

## Card Structure

Each card contains:
- **Purpose**: What problem it solves
- **Use When**: Situational triggers
- **What This Card Holds**: Content types
- **What This Card Does NOT Do**: Boundaries
- **Human-Filled Fields**: Sections you fill
- **Assistant Behavior**: How AI responds when card is active
- **Update Rules**: How card content evolves
- **Example**: Filled card demonstration
- **Relationship to Other Cards**: Connections

## Typical Workflows

### Exploratory Thinking
Cards: 01 (Alignment), 05 (Notes), 07 (Questions)  
Purpose: Think out loud without losing threads

### Decision-Making
Cards: 01 (Alignment), 02 (Constraints), 09 (Decisions)  
Purpose: Lock choices, prevent re-litigation

### Building Something
Cards: 02 (Constraints), 09 (Decisions), 13 (Build)  
Purpose: Stepwise execution with no drift

### Long Conversations
Cards: 01 (Alignment), 11 (Context Handoff), 12 (Progress)  
Purpose: Prevent amnesia across sessions

### Clarification & Alignment
Cards: 06 (Assumptions), 10 (Definitions), 03 (Intent)  
Purpose: Surface hidden misalignments

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

❌ Treating cards as forms to fill  
❌ Using all 13 cards at once  
❌ Expecting automatic enforcement  
❌ Assuming cards replace clear communication  
❌ Over-structuring exploration  
❌ Letting assistant modify card content

## Design Philosophy

**Structure precedes automation.**  
Thinking is treated as engineering.

This deck exists because:
- Conversations drift without persistent structure
- LLMs optimize for recency, not intent
- Human memory is fallible across long sessions
- Traditional prompts are one-shot optimizations
- Complex thinking needs external scaffolding

The deck provides **grounding** — a stable conversational foundation that persists across turns, sessions, and even model switches.
