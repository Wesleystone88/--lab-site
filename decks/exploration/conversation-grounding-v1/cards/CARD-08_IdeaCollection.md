CardID: CARD-08
CardName: Idea Collection
Mode: Exploration
Status: draft
Owner: Timothy Wesley Stone

Purpose:
Provide a safe place to collect, cluster, and preserve ideas as they appear
during conversation—without forcing evaluation, structure, or decisions.

This card answers:
"What ideas have surfaced that we don't want to lose?"

Use When:
- Ideas appear faster than you can evaluate them
- You want to keep momentum without deciding
- Multiple directions are emerging
- You don't want good ideas buried in chat history
- You want to revisit ideas later with fresh context

What This Card Holds:
- Raw ideas
- Half-formed concepts
- Alternate approaches
- Naming ideas
- Feature thoughts
- Metaphors or analogies
- "What if…" statements

What This Card Does NOT Do:
- It does not judge idea quality
- It does not prioritize automatically
- It does not assume ideas must be used
- It does not imply commitment

Human-Filled Fields:

A) Raw Ideas (Unfiltered):
- <ideas exactly as they surfaced>
Examples:
- "What if the deck had a 'conversation temperature' card?"
- "Random topic cards for creative exploration."
- "Physical index-card version of this."

B) Grouped / Clustered Ideas (Optional):
- <light grouping without evaluation>
Examples:
- UX Ideas:
  - "Visual card pins"
  - "Collapsed card summaries"
- Product Ideas:
  - "Starter decks"
  - "Printable cards"

C) Ideas Under Light Consideration:
- <ideas you keep glancing at>
Examples:
- "13-card build sequence."
- "Exploration vs Canonical decks."

D) Ideas to Revisit Later:
- <explicitly parked>
Examples:
- "AI-assisted card summarization."
- "Public deck sharing gallery."

Assistant Behavior When This Card Is Active:
- Add ideas verbatim when suggested
- Do not optimize or rephrase unless asked
- Do not evaluate unless prompted
- Help cluster only when requested
- Respect that some ideas stay messy

Update Rules:
- Ideas may move between sections
- Deleting ideas is allowed but discouraged
- Old ideas can be revived at any time
- Silence ≠ rejection

Relationship to Other Cards:
- Feeds into: Build Plan, Decisions, Intent
- Paired with: Open Questions
- Helps maintain creative flow

Example (filled):
Raw Idea:
- "Conversation cards for therapy-like journaling."

Notes:
This card exists to protect creativity from premature structure.
