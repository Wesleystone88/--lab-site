CardID: CARD-05
CardName: Notes & Idea Collection
Mode: Exploration
Status: draft
Owner: Timothy Wesley Stone

Purpose:
Provide a persistent place to collect thoughts, fragments, partial ideas,
and observations *without forcing structure or decisions*.

This card answers:
"Where do ideas go when they're not ready yet?"

Use When:
- Ideas appear mid-conversation
- You don't want to lose a thought
- Something is interesting but premature
- You need a scratchpad that persists
- Multiple loose threads are forming

What This Card Holds:
- Raw notes
- Half-formed ideas
- Observations
- Quotes or phrasing worth keeping
- References to revisit later
- Brain-dump material

What This Card Does NOT Do:
- It does not organize ideas
- It does not decide importance
- It does not resolve contradictions
- It does not imply commitment

Human-Filled Fields:

A) Active Notes:
- <free-form notes added during conversation>
Examples:
- "The deck feels like a cognitive stabilizer, not a tool."
- "Cards should feel optional, not bureaucratic."
- "This could help people who think out loud."

B) Parked Ideas:
- <ideas acknowledged but deferred>
Examples:
- "Could later turn this into a workshop."
- "Might need a visual metaphor for cards."

C) Language Worth Keeping:
- <phrases, metaphors, wording>
Examples:
- "The conversation orbits the cards."
- "Stability without enforcement."

D) Questions to Revisit:
- <open questions with no urgency>
Examples:
- "How many cards is too many?"
- "What makes a card feel alive?"

Assistant Behavior When This Card Is Active:
- Suggest adding ideas here instead of derailing flow
- Refer back to notes when relevant
- Do not elevate notes into decisions automatically
- Treat this card as non-authoritative memory

Update Rules:
- Notes can be added anytime
- Notes can be deleted without ceremony
- Notes may later be promoted into other cards
- Messiness is allowed and expected

Relationship to Other Cards:
- Feeds into: Intent, Build, Decisions, Definitions
- Often paired with: Scope & Boundaries
- Never blocks progress

Example (filled):
Active Notes:
- "This deck is about orientation, not answers."

Parked Ideas:
- "Possible name variations."

Notes:
This card protects creativity.
It absorbs noise so the rest of the conversation can stay clean.
