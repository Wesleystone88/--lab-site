# Conversation Grounding Deck — Exploration Mode
# CARD-13 — BUILD CARD (Stepwise Execution)
# Author: Timothy Wesley Stone
# License: Open / Shareable
# ============================================================

CardID: CARD-13
CardName: Build Card (Stepwise Execution)
Mode: Exploration (Conversation Grounding)
Status: ready
Owner: Timothy Wesley Stone

Purpose:
Turn a fuzzy goal into a disciplined, step-by-step conversation where the assistant
executes ONE step at a time, reports back, and cannot rewrite earlier steps once
the build has progressed.

Use When:
- You want the chat to "build something" without drifting
- You want progress in ordered steps
- You want strong anti-scope-creep behavior
- You want a repeatable procedure you can resume later

Card Rules (Hard):
R1. One step at a time. The assistant only performs the CURRENT step.
R2. No retro-edits. Once Step 1 is completed and Step 2 begins, Step 1 is frozen.
R3. The assistant must NOT merge steps, skip steps, or jump ahead.
R4. Each step ends with a "Step Report" and a "Ready for Step N+1" marker.
R5. If the assistant believes a prior step is wrong, it must log it in "Issues"
    and propose a fix as a NEW future step (Step N+K), not by rewriting history.
R6. If the human changes the goal mid-run, the assistant must ask to create a new
    Build Run ID (fork) OR append a Change Request step at the end.

What the Human Fills In:
A) Build Goal (one sentence):
- <what you want built>

B) Definition of Done:
- <how we know it's finished>

C) Output Type:
- <plan | checklist | outline | prompt | code | doc | mixed>

D) Step List (ordered, explicit):
Step 1: <...>
Step 2: <...>
Step 3: <...>
...
Step N: <...>

E) Constraints for the Build:
- <time, tools, tone, risk, do/don’t>

F) Build Run ID:
- <YYYY-MM-DD shortname> (example: 2026-01-20-groundingdeck)

G) Reporting Format (pick one):
- ( ) Brief
- ( ) Normal
- ( ) Detailed

Assistant Execution Script (paste this into chat with the filled card):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You are now running BUILD CARD (Stepwise Execution).

Build Run ID: <ID>
Build Goal: <Goal>
Definition of Done: <DoD>
Output Type: <OutputType>
Constraints: <Constraints>
Reporting Format: <Brief|Normal|Detailed>

Step List (Frozen once Step 1 begins):
1) <Step 1>
2) <Step 2>
3) <Step 3>
...
N) <Step N>

Execution Rules (must obey):
- Do ONLY Step 1 right now.
- Do NOT alter Step 1 after finishing it.
- After completing Step 1, provide a Step Report with:
  * What was done
  * What was produced (artifact/output)
  * Any issues discovered (without rewriting Step 1)
  * What is needed for Step 2
- Then end with exactly:
  READY FOR STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Step Report Template (assistant must use):
- Step Completed: Step <N>
- Output Produced:
  - <bullets or links or pasted artifact>
- Decisions Locked:
  - <bullets>
- Issues Logged (no retro-edits):
  - <bullets>
- Inputs Needed for Next Step:
  - <bullets>
- READY FOR STEP <N+1>

Notes:
- This card is compatible with re-uploading / re-pasting across sessions.
- If the conversation resets, paste this card and the last Step Report to resume.

Now lets make the other 12 1 at a time for context an the ability  to actually make each 1 good dont do this fast 

Perfect. We’ll do this slow, deliberate, one-card-at-a-time, and each card will be useful in real conversations, not abstract fluff.

I’ll treat this like we’re forging tools, not filling slots.

We already have CARD-13 (Build Card) locked.
Now we start at the beginning of the Conversation Grounding Deck — Exploration Mode.

I’ll propose CARD-01 first. After you review it, we adjust or lock it, then move on to CARD-02. No rushing.

# ============================================================
# Conversation Grounding Deck — Exploration Mode
# CARD-01 — ALIGNMENT ANCHOR
# Author: Timothy Wesley Stone
# License: Open / Shareable
# ============================================================

CardID: CARD-01
CardName: Alignment Anchor
Mode: Exploration
Status: draft
Owner: Timothy Wesley Stone

Purpose:
Hold the *current reason this conversation exists* so it doesn’t silently drift
as topics expand, questions branch, or details accumulate.

This card answers:
“What are we actually trying to do together right now?”

Use When:
- A conversation is longer than a few turns
- You feel the assistant is optimizing the last message instead of the goal
- The discussion starts branching into multiple directions
- You catch yourself repeating “what I’m trying to do is…”

What This Card Holds:
- The current primary intent (not the final outcome)
- The reason this conversation is happening *at this moment*
- The frame of collaboration (explore, decide, plan, build, learn, vent, etc.)

What This Card Does NOT Do:
- It does not lock scope
- It does not define steps
- It does not enforce correctness
- It does not prevent evolution

This card is allowed to change over time.

Human-Filled Fields:
A) Current Alignment Statement (1–3 sentences):
- <plain language description of why this conversation exists>

B) Collaboration Mode (pick one or describe):
- explore ideas
- clarify understanding
- make a decision
- plan something
- build something
- reflect / think out loud
- other: <freeform>

C) What Would Make This Conversation “Worth It”:
- <not success criteria — just a sanity check>

Assistant Behavior When This Card Is Active:
- Prefer responses that serve the Alignment Statement
- If a response would significantly diverge, flag it
- Ask for confirmation before shifting collaboration mode
- Reference this card implicitly when choosing depth and tone

Update Rules:
- The human may update this card at any time
- The assistant may suggest updates but may NOT change it unilaterally
- Old alignment statements may be preserved as history if helpful

Example (filled):
Alignment:
“I’m trying to design a lightweight system that keeps AI conversations coherent
without turning them into rigid workflows.”

Collaboration Mode:
explore ideas

Worth It If:
“I leave with something I can actually use in real chats.”

Notes:
This is usually the FIRST card introduced in a conversation,
but it can also be reintroduced later to re-center things.

Pause point (intentional)

Before we move on:

Does this card feel useful in a real chat?

Is the name right, or do you want a different feel (e.g. Intent Anchor, Why Card, North Star)?

Should it be lighter or stronger in how it influences the assistant?

Once you say lock it or request changes, we’ll move to CARD-02.

We will lock all in ill try them then adjust go ahead 

Locked.
We’ll continue in order, one card at a time, same depth, no rushing.

# ============================================================
# Conversation Grounding Deck — Exploration Mode
# CARD-02 — CONSTRAINTS & RULES
# Author: Timothy Wesley Stone
# License: Open / Shareable
# ============================================================

CardID: CARD-02
CardName: Constraints & Rules
Mode: Exploration
Status: draft
Owner: Timothy Wesley Stone

Purpose:
Hold explicit rules, limits, and boundaries that the conversation must respect,
so they don’t need to be repeated or rediscovered.

This card answers:
“What rules are we operating under?”

Use When:
- You keep correcting the assistant on the same behavior
- There are hard limits you don’t want violated
- You want consistency across many turns
- The assistant keeps ‘helpfully’ doing things you don’t want

What This Card Holds:
- Hard constraints (must not be violated)
- Soft preferences (should usually be followed)
- Behavioral rules for the assistant
- Scope limits that are *not* the same as intent

What This Card Does NOT Do:
- It does not define goals
- It does not define steps
- It does not require completeness
- It does not block exploration unless explicitly stated

Human-Filled Fields:

A) Hard Constraints (non-negotiable):
- <rules that must always be followed>
Examples:
- “Do not rewrite my text unless I ask.”
- “Do not introduce frameworks unless requested.”
- “One step per message.”
- “Do not optimize for politeness over clarity.”

B) Soft Preferences (guidelines):
- <rules that usually apply but may bend>
Examples:
- “Prefer concrete examples.”
- “Ask before switching topics.”
- “Keep explanations compact unless I say ‘go deep’.”

C) Forbidden Behaviors:
- <things the assistant should actively avoid>
Examples:
- “Don’t summarize unless asked.”
- “Don’t auto-complete plans.”
- “Don’t skip steps.”

Assistant Behavior When This Card Is Active:
- Treat Hard Constraints as inviolable
- Treat Soft Preferences as defaults
- Flag conflicts instead of guessing
- Ask for clarification when rules collide

Update Rules:
- Human may add, remove, or change constraints at any time
- Assistant may suggest constraints but never enforce new ones
- Old constraints may remain listed but marked inactive if needed

Example (filled):
Hard:
- “Only do one thing per message.”
- “Do not assume my end goal.”

Soft:
- “Prefer short answers unless I say ‘expand’.”

Forbidden:
- “Don’t jump ahead in plans.”

Notes:
This card is often introduced early,
but it becomes especially valuable once conversations get long.


We’ll pause again here.

When you’re ready, say continue, and we’ll move to CARD-03 (which will not be scope — I’m intentionally sequencing these for conversational flow).

# ============================================================
# Conversation Grounding Deck — Exploration Mode
# CARD-03 — INTENT & DIRECTION
# Author: Timothy Wesley Stone
# License: Open / Shareable
# ============================================================

CardID: CARD-03
CardName: Intent & Direction
Mode: Exploration
Status: draft
Owner: Timothy Wesley Stone

Purpose:
Anchor what the conversation is fundamentally trying to do *right now*,
without locking it into a final outcome.

This card answers:
“What are we aiming at, even if we don’t know how yet?”

Use When:
- The conversation feels busy but unfocused
- The assistant optimizes for the last message instead of the bigger picture
- You want exploration, but with a direction
- You’re unsure of the solution but clear on the problem space

What This Card Holds:
- Current intent (not final goals)
- Direction of exploration
- What progress looks like *for now*
- What would count as “useful movement”

What This Card Does NOT Do:
- It does not define steps
- It does not freeze decisions
- It does not block pivots
- It does not require precision

Human-Filled Fields:

A) Current Intent (plain language):
- <what you are trying to accomplish or understand>
Examples:
- “Figure out what kind of product this could become.”
- “Explore whether this idea is worth pursuing.”
- “Clarify the shape of the problem before solving it.”

B) Direction of Travel:
- <where exploration should generally move>
Examples:
- “Toward clarity, not implementation.”
- “Toward feasibility, not polish.”
- “Toward understanding tradeoffs.”

C) What Progress Looks Like:
- <signals that the conversation is helping>
Examples:
- “Fewer contradictions.”
- “Clearer language.”
- “Better questions than answers.”

D) What Is Explicitly NOT the Goal (right now):
- <temporary non-goals>
Examples:
- “Not writing code yet.”
- “Not deciding architecture.”
- “Not naming things.”

Assistant Behavior When This Card Is Active:
- Optimize responses toward the stated direction
- Avoid premature solutions
- Reflect intent drift if it appears
- Ask alignment questions when intent becomes unclear

Update Rules:
- Intent may change freely
- Old intent can be retained as history if useful
- Assistant may restate intent to check alignment, but not redefine it

Example (filled):
Intent:
- “Understand how this system should feel to use.”

Direction:
- “Exploratory, conceptual.”

Progress:
- “Cleaner mental model.”

Not-Goals:
- “No implementation decisions yet.”

Notes:
This card can coexist with uncertainty.
If intent feels fuzzy, that fuzziness belongs here rather than being ignored.

# ============================================================
# Conversation Grounding Deck — Exploration Mode
# CARD-04 — SCOPE & BOUNDARIES
# Author: Timothy Wesley Stone
# License: Open / Shareable
# ============================================================

CardID: CARD-04
CardName: Scope & Boundaries
Mode: Exploration
Status: draft
Owner: Timothy Wesley Stone

Purpose:
Define what the conversation *is* and *is not* allowed to touch,
so exploration stays meaningful instead of sprawling.

This card answers:
“What territory are we exploring — and what is outside the fence for now?”

Use When:
- The conversation starts expanding too fast
- Too many ideas compete for attention
- You feel cognitive overload or dilution
- You want depth over breadth
- You need to park ideas without losing them

What This Card Holds:
- In-scope topics
- Out-of-scope topics (temporary or permanent)
- Soft boundaries (discouraged areas)
- Hard boundaries (do not cross)
- Parking rules for off-topic ideas

What This Card Does NOT Do:
- It does not decide priorities
- It does not rank ideas
- It does not block curiosity forever
- It does not enforce structure rigidly

Human-Filled Fields:

A) In-Scope (actively explored):
- <topics/questions that belong here>
Examples:
- “Conversation grounding methods.”
- “Everyday-user cognitive support.”
- “Non-technical card systems.”

B) Out-of-Scope (for now):
- <explicit exclusions>
Examples:
- “Implementation details.”
- “LLM internals.”
- “Business scaling.”

C) Soft Boundaries:
- <allowed but discouraged unless relevant>
Examples:
- “Technical jargon.”
- “Premature optimization.”
- “Tool comparisons.”

D) Hard Boundaries:
- <do-not-cross lines>
Examples:
- “No code.”
- “No monetization talk yet.”
- “No agent frameworks.”

E) Parking Rule:
- <what to do when ideas fall outside scope>
Examples:
- “Summarize and park in a Notes or Parking card.”
- “Acknowledge briefly, then return to scope.”

Assistant Behavior When This Card Is Active:
- Keep responses within scope
- Flag boundary crossings gently
- Offer to park ideas rather than pursue them
- Help narrow when scope starts to blur

Update Rules:
- Scope can be adjusted at any time
- Out-of-scope items can be promoted later
- Assistant may suggest scope tightening but not enforce it

Example (filled):
In-Scope:
- “Designing conversational grounding cards.”

Out-of-Scope:
- “Full product spec.”

Soft Boundary:
- “Market talk.”

Hard Boundary:
- “No implementation.”

Parking:
- “Create a parking note.”

Notes:
This card is about *focus*, not restriction.
Good exploration needs fences to go deep.

- “This could help people who think out loud.”

B) Parked Ideas:
- <ideas acknowledged but deferred>
Examples:
- “Could later turn this into a workshop.”
- “Might need a visual metaphor for cards.”

C) Language Worth Keeping:
- <phrases, metaphors, wording>
Examples:
- “The conversation orbits the cards.”
- “Stability without enforcement.”

D) Questions to Revisit:
- <open questions with no urgency>
Examples:
- “How many cards is too many?”
- “What makes a card feel alive?”

Assistant Behavior When This Card Is Active:
- Suggest adding ideas here instead of derailing flow
- Refer back to notes when relevant
- Do not elevate notes into decisions automatically
- Treat this card as non-authoritative memory

Update Rules:
- Notes can be added anytime
- Notes can be deleted without ceremony

Relationship to Other Cards:
- Feeds into: Intent, Build, Decisions, Definitions
- Often paired with: Scope & Boundaries
- Never blocks progress

Example (filled):
Active Notes:
- “This deck is about orientation, not answers.”

Parked Ideas:

CardID: CARD-06
CardName: Assumptions & Beliefs
Mode: Exploration
Status: draft
Owner: Timothy Wesley Stone

Purpose:
Make hidden assumptions visible so the conversation doesn’t quietly
build on shaky or unexamined foundations.

This card answers:
“What are we currently assuming to be true?”

Use When:
- Disagreements feel implicit rather than explicit
- The assistant or human keeps talking past each other
- You suspect different mental models are in play
- Something feels “off” but you can’t pinpoint why
- You want to sanity-check the conversation’s foundation

What This Card Holds:
- Assumptions (explicit or implicit)
- Beliefs guiding reasoning
- Working theories
- Default perspectives
- Temporary hypotheses

What This Card Does NOT Do:
- It does not declare truth
- It does not resolve disagreements
- It does not enforce correctness
- It does not freeze beliefs permanently

Human-Filled Fields:

A) Human Assumptions:
- <what you are assuming, knowingly or not>
Examples:
- “Most people don’t want rigid systems.”
- “Conversation drift is a real problem.”
- “Lightweight tools outperform heavy frameworks.”

B) Assistant Assumptions (as observed):
- <what the assistant seems to assume>
Examples:
- “Structure should be progressive.”
- “Humans want optional guidance, not enforcement.”

C) Shared Working Assumptions:
- <assumptions both sides seem aligned on>
Examples:
- “This deck is exploratory, not prescriptive.”
- “Cards should reduce friction, not add it.”

D) Questioned Assumptions:
- <assumptions under review>
Examples:
- “Do users actually want to manage cards?”
- “Is persistence more important than speed?”

Assistant Behavior When This Card Is Active:
- Surface assumptions explicitly
- Ask clarifying questions when assumptions conflict
- Avoid treating assumptions as facts
- Update this card when assumptions shift

Update Rules:
- Assumptions may change frequently
- Old assumptions can remain for historical context
- New assumptions should be dated or tagged if helpful

Relationship to Other Cards:
- Feeds into: Intent, Constraints, Decisions
- Often paired with: Scope & Alignment
- Useful before making commitments

Example (filled):
Human Assumption:
- “People will use this during thinking, not afterward.”

Questioned:
- “Is this too abstract for everyday users?”

Notes:
This card prevents quiet divergence.
Most conversation failures start as unspoken assumptions.

CardName: Decisions
Mode: Exploration
Status: draft
Owner: Timothy Wesley Stone

Purpose:
Create a single, visible place where decisions are recorded once they are made,
so they do not drift, get re-litigated, or silently change over time.

This card answers:
“What have we actually decided so far?”

Use When:
- The same choice keeps coming up again
- The assistant contradicts earlier conclusions
- You want to stop re-arguing settled points
- Progress depends on locking something down
- You need a memory anchor across sessions

Assistant Behavior When This Card Is Active:
- Treat Locked Decisions as constraints
- Respect Provisional Decisions but allow challenge
- Do not override decisions silently
- Surface conflicts with new suggestions
- Ask before revisiting locked items

Update Rules:
- Decisions may move between sections

- Protects uncertainty from premature closure

Example (filled):
Active:
- “Should this deck be sold as a PDF or templates first?”

Notes:
Unanswered questions are assets, not bugs.


Locked as CARD-10 (draft).

Say next when ready for CARD-11.

CardID: CARD-11
CardName: Decisions
Mode: Exploration
Status: draft
Owner: Timothy Wesley Stone

Purpose:
Capture decisions explicitly so they stop drifting, being re-litigated,
or silently reversed by later turns in the conversation.

This card answers:
“What have we actually decided so far?”

Use When:
- The same choice keeps getting revisited
- The assistant contradicts earlier conclusions
- Progress depends on locking something in
- You want to move forward without perfect certainty
- Tradeoffs have been accepted

What This Card Holds:
- Explicit decisions
- Accepted tradeoffs
- Chosen defaults
- Ruled-out alternatives (with reason)
- Temporary decisions (clearly marked)

What This Card Does NOT Do:
- It does not claim decisions are permanent
- It does not prevent revisiting (only makes it explicit)
- It does not enforce correctness
- It does not replace Intent or Scope

Human-Filled Fields:

A) Locked Decisions:
- <decisions treated as stable>
Format:
- Decision:
- Rationale:
- Date / Context:

Example:
- Decision: “This deck is not a prompt pack.”
  Rationale: Avoids output-optimization framing.
  Context: Grounding deck definition.

B) Provisional Decisions:
- <decisions accepted for now, revisit later>
Format:
- Decision:
- Condition for Revisit:

Example:
- Decision: “Start with ~13 cards.”
  Revisit If: User testing shows overload.

C) Rejected Options:
- <explicitly ruled out paths>
Format:
- Option:
- Reason Rejected:

Example:
- Option: “Automatic enforcement engine”
  Reason: Violates human-first principle.

D) Decision Notes:
- <nuance, tradeoffs, or risks>

Assistant Behavior When This Card Is Active:
- Respect listed decisions as current truth
- Flag when a response contradicts a decision
- Ask before proposing changes
- Treat provisional decisions as soft, not fixed
- Help clarify consequences of changing a decision

Update Rules:
- Decisions must be explicitly written to count
- Silent assumption ≠ decision
- Changes require explicit edit or supersession note
- Old decisions may remain with status “superseded”

Relationship to Other Cards:
- Resolves: Open Questions
- Constrains: Build Plan, Scope, Constraints
- Informs: Intent refinement

Example (filled):
Locked:
- “This deck is chat-native and tool-agnostic.”

Provisional:
- “Sell as a lightweight PDF first.”

Note:
Decisions create momentum.

# ============================================================
# Conversation Grounding Deck — Exploration Mode
# CARD-12 — BUILD CARD
# Author: Timothy Wesley Stone
# License: Open / Shareable
# ============================================================

CardID: CARD-12
CardName: Build Card
Mode: Exploration
Status: draft
Owner: Timothy Wesley Stone

Purpose:
Provide a step-by-step execution container that allows a human and an LLM
to collaboratively build something in a controlled, sequential, non-drifting way.

This card answers:
“What are we building right now, and in what order must it happen?”

This is the ONLY card that imposes strict sequencing behavior.

Use When:
- You want the assistant to execute a multi-step task
- You want one step per message, no skipping
- You want earlier steps frozen once completed
- You want progress reports instead of freeform output
- You want to prevent scope creep mid-build

What This Card Holds:
- A clearly defined build goal
- An ordered list of steps
- Step-level success criteria
- Step completion state
- Build constraints specific to this task

What This Card Does NOT Do:
- It does not redefine global intent
- It does not allow step reordering mid-run
- It does not optimize or refactor earlier steps automatically
- It does not enforce correctness beyond declared criteria

Human-Filled Fields:

A) Build Goal:
- <single, concrete outcome>

Example:
Build Goal:
“Create a sellable Conversation Grounding Deck PDF.”

B) Build Rules:
- One step per assistant response
- Steps executed strictly in order
- Once a step is marked complete, it is frozen
- Assistant must wait for explicit human confirmation before proceeding
- No new steps may be inserted mid-run without restarting the build

C) Ordered Steps:
Format:
Step N:
- Description:
- Output Required:
- Completion Criteria:

Example:
Step 1:
- Description: Define final card list and names
- Output Required: Confirmed list of 13 cards
- Completion Criteria: Human approval

Step 2:
- Description: Write full content for CARD-01 through CARD-13
- Output Required: Draft card texts
- Completion Criteria: Each card reviewed

Step 3:
- Description: Create packaging format (PDF + text)
- Output Required: Export-ready structure
- Completion Criteria: Files listed and named

D) Active Step Pointer:
- Current Step: <number>
- Status: pending | in-progress | complete

E) Step Log:
- <timestamped notes per completed step>

Assistant Behavior When This Card Is Active:
- Execute ONLY the current step
- Do NOT reference future steps
- Do NOT modify completed steps
- Report progress at end of response
- Ask for confirmation before advancing
- Flag blockers explicitly

Failure Handling:
- If a step cannot be completed, report why
- Offer options without advancing
- Never silently skip or merge steps

Relationship to Other Cards:
- Consumes: Intent, Scope, Constraints, Decisions
- Produces: Concrete progress
- Freezes: Prior reasoning into execution

Example Invocation:
Human:
“Use the Build Card. Start Step 1.”

Assistant:
“Executing Step 1 only…”

Example Completion Signal:
“Step 1 complete. Awaiting confirmation to proceed.”

Note:
This card turns conversation into a controlled build pipeline
without requiring tools, agents, or external orchestration.
