# ============================================================

This document establishes the canonical foundation for νόησις and its
deck-based thinking systems. It exists to transfer context across chats,
models, tools, and collaborators without loss of intent.

This is not a product spec.
This is not a single tool.
This is the governing mental model.

============================================================
1. WHAT νόησις IS
============================================================

νόησις is the business and conceptual engine that unifies multiple
thinking, design, and reasoning systems under a single philosophy.

νόησις is NOT:
- A single product
- A single LLM tool
- A single framework
- A single deck

νόησις IS:
- A human-first cognitive engineering company
- A system for turning thought into durable artifacts
- A foundation that can run many engines, tools, and products over time

Products (decks, FORGE, TGD, etc.) live UNDER νόησις.
They are components, not the identity.

============================================================
2. CORE PHILOSOPHY
============================================================

- Humans own decisions
- Structure prevents drift
- Thinking is treated as engineering when outcomes matter
- Not all thinking should be engineered
- Tools must adapt to cognitive load, not the other way around
- Plain text portability is a feature, not a limitation

============================================================
3. THE DECK SYSTEM (HIGH-LEVEL)
============================================================

νόησις uses "decks" as portable thinking systems.

A deck is:
- A collection of cards
- Each card is a self-contained artifact
- Cards persist across time, tools, and LLM sessions

There are MULTIPLE deck families.
They do NOT follow the same rules.

============================================================
4. THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION: DECK MODES
============================================================

Decks are classified by *cognitive mode*, not by version number.

There are TWO canonical modes:

------------------------------------------------------------
A) ENGINEERING MODE (Technical / Power User Decks)
------------------------------------------------------------

Audience:
- Engineers
- Researchers
- System designers
- Technical builders

Purpose:
- Turn ideas into buildable, auditable systems

Properties:
- Ordered cards
- Explicit gates
- Upstream / downstream rules
- Completeness expectations
- Drift detection
- High rigor

Examples:
- Artifact Decks
- Emergence Deck
- Canonical Deck
- System architecture decks
- FORGE-related specs

Two engineering decks currently exist:

1) Emergence Deck (formerly v0.1)
   - Used early
   - Partial filling allowed
   - Exploration inside structure
   - Lower enforcement
   - Still ordered and gated

2) Canonical Deck (formerly v1.0)
   - Used when correctness matters
   - Full specification required
   - Strict gates
   - Bulletproof logic before implementation

These decks are TECHNICAL by design.
They intentionally have a learning curve.

------------------------------------------------------------
B) EXPLORATION MODE (Everyday / Common User Decks)
------------------------------------------------------------

Audience:
- General users
- Non-technical users
- Mixed-skill users
- Early thinking stages

Purpose:
- Support thinking as it actually happens
- Learn, explore, organize, reflect

Properties:
- No fixed order
- Topic-based cards
- Cards are independent
- Contradictions allowed
- Partial cards allowed forever
- Discovery > enforcement

These decks are NOT engineering tools.
They are cognitive support tools.

============================================================
5. PACKAGE RULE (VERY IMPORTANT)
============================================================

The PACKAGE determines deck behavior.

Engineering decks:
- PackageType: Software / Research / System
- DeckMode: Engineering
- Structure: Ordered, gated

Exploration decks:
- PackageType: Knowledge / Learning / Life / Ideas
- DeckMode: Exploration
- Structure: Non-linear, topic-based

Changing the PACKAGE changes the rules.
The card system itself is not broken.

============================================================
6. CARD RULES BY MODE
============================================================

ENGINEERING MODE:
- Cards are specifications
- Cards must be complete
- Gates apply
- Order matters
- Drift is an error

EXPLORATION MODE:
- Cards are thoughts, topics, questions, or tools
- Cards may be incomplete
- No gates
- No required order
- Drift is allowed

Minimal Exploration Card Template:

- Card Title
- What this is about
- Why it matters (optional)
- Examples (optional)
- Notes / thoughts
- Related cards (optional)

============================================================
7. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MODES
============================================================

Exploration decks can FEED engineering decks.

Engineering decks NEVER replace exploration decks.

Flow:
Exploration → Engineering
(never the reverse)

Exploration decks are never "upgraded".
They remain loose forever.

============================================================
8. WHAT IS ALREADY BUILT
============================================================

- Artifact Deck system
- Emergence Deck (Engineering Mode)
- Canonical Deck (Engineering Mode)
- Governance decisions (naming, gates, usage)
- Branding under νόησις
- Clear separation of business (νόησις) vs products

============================================================
9. WHAT IS BEING BUILT NEXT (IN OTHER CHAT)
============================================================

- Exploration Mode decks
- Everyday user cards
- Topic-based, non-linear structures
- Lower cognitive load
- Designed for learning and thinking, not system building

These do NOT replace the Artifact Decks.
They complement them.

============================================================
10. ONE-SENTENCE RULE
============================================================

Engineering decks enforce structure to build systems.
Exploration decks support thinking without forcing outcomes.

============================================================
END OF FOUNDATION
============================================================
