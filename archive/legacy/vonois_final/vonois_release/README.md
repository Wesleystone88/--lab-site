# vónoįs Artifact Deck

Author: Timothy Wesley Stone  
License: MIT (Open / Shareable)

A portable, human-first method for converting vague ideas into structured, durable
artifacts that survive LLM context loss, model switching, and collaboration.

No engine required. Works with plain text, markdown, copy/paste, git, or zip.

## Which deck should you use?

Use **v0.1** if you are sitting down to code an app right now and just want the LLM
to stay organized and not forget the file structure.

Use **v1.0** if you are designing a system (like the Quantum Toaster) and want to make
sure the logic is bulletproof before you start implementation.

## How to use

1. Copy `templates/PACKAGE_TEMPLATE.md` into a new project folder.
2. Select DeckMode (v0.1 or v1.0).
3. Copy the corresponding cards from `deck/<mode>/cards/`.
4. Fill cards in order.
5. Lock cards when stable.
6. Share via git, zip, or paste into LLMs.
