# vónoįs Template Upgrade Pack

This zip contains improved, copy/paste-first templates that match the vónoįs deck philosophy:
- Human-first, portable, engine-agnostic
- Forces concrete, operational specs (not vague notes)
- Works for both v0.1 (execution) and v1.0 (design)

## Files
- templates/PACKAGE_TEMPLATE.md
- templates/CARD_TEMPLATE.md
- templates/LLM_FILL_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md

## How to use
1) Drop these into your existing vónoįs repo under /templates
2) When starting a new project, copy PACKAGE_TEMPLATE first
3) Then copy CARD_TEMPLATE for each card you want to create
4) Optional: use LLM_FILL_PROMPT_TEMPLATE to have any model draft content safely
