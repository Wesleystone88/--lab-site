Purpose:
Define the immutable realities governing the system.

Contains:
- Budget limits
- Time constraints
- Hardware limits
- Latency ceilings
- API quotas
- Skill constraints
- Regulatory limits
- Data limits
- Energy / compute limits

Outputs:
- Feasible design envelope.

Gate:
- Constraints must be respected by downstream cards.
