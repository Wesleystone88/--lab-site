# ============================================================
# CORE PRINCIPLES
# ============================================================

- Cards are full specifications, not summaries.
- Cards are human-readable and portable.
- Cards persist across tools and models.
- LLMs assist but do not replace ownership.
- Drift must be visible and correctable.
- Structure precedes automation.
- Thinking is treated as engineering.
