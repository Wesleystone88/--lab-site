# CARD-9 — FAILURE & RECOVERY (Resilience)

Purpose:
Define how the system fails and heals.

Contains:
- Failure modes
- Silent failure risks
- Partial failure behavior
- Data corruption risks
- Human error risks
- Detection mechanisms
- Recovery strategies
- Rollback procedures

Outputs:
- Operational resilience plan.

Gate:
- Critical failures must have recovery paths.
