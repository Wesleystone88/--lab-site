# CARD-0 — PACKAGE (Domain Envelope)

Purpose:
Declare what kind of thing this project fundamentally is before intent is defined.
Prevents category confusion and hidden assumption drift.

Contains:
- Project Class: software | research | hardware | protocol | social | hybrid
- Execution Mode: human-only | LLM-assisted | automated | mixed
- Artifact Types: code | documents | datasets | models | hardware | simulations
- Distribution: open | closed | internal | regulated
- Longevity: prototype | production | archival | disposable
- Compliance Scope: legal, safety, privacy, export, medical, etc.
- Success Horizon: experiment | MVP | long-term system
