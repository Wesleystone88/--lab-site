  "description": "# νόησις (Noesis) — Blueprint Reasoning Engine\n\n**νόησις** is a high-fidelity reasoning workspace designed to test the hypothesis that **persistent shared state** (a \"Canvas\") significantly improves the deductive stability and coherence of Large Language Models.\n\nInspired by the visual logic of the **Unreal Engine Blueprint system**, this application provides a dual-pane environment where an AI reasoning engine and a human collaborator build a structured logic graph in real-time.\n\n## 🧠 Core Philosophy: Structured Memory\nTraditional LLM chat interfaces suffer from \"context drift\"—the model loses track of deep constraints or intermediate derivations over long sessions. νόησις solves this by:\n1.  **Durable State**: A shared \"Canvas\" that acts as the model's primary working memory.\n2.  **Step-Wise Logic**: Enforcing a protocol where the model performs exactly one logical step per turn.\n3.  **Visual Verification**: Mapping logic to a node-based graph, allowing users to visually trace execution flow and data dependencies.\n\n## 🛠️ Features\n- **Graph Workspace**: An Unreal Engine-style node editor featuring:\n    - **Execution Pins**: Triangle-based flow control representing logical sequence.\n    - **Data Pins**: Circle-based inputs representing variables and constraints.\n    - **Categorical Grouping**: Nodes are automatically sorted into *Objectives*, *Constraints*, *Pipeline*, and *Status*.\n- **Inference Stream**: A side-panel for conversational reasoning and collaborative prompting.\n- **Neural Patch Protocol**: The model doesn't just talk; it proposes **Logic Patches** (diffs) to the shared state. Users must \"Verify\" and \"Synchronize\" these patches to update the global memory.\n- **Deductive Templates**: Specialized schemas for Systems Architecture, Mathematical Proofs, and Creative Strategy.\n\n## 🏗️ Technical Stack\n- **Engine**: Google Gemini 3 (Pro Preview) with optimized Thinking Config.\n- **Frontend**: React (ESM) + Tailwind CSS + Lucide Icons.\n- **Visuals**: SVG-based dynamic wiring with cubic bezier curves and glowing UE-inspired aesthetics.\n- **Math**: KaTeX support for complex derivations within the graph.\n\n## 🚀 How to use\n1.  **Initialize**: Choose a Logic Protocol and define your \"Target Objective.\"\n2.  **Build**: Use the \"Run Blueprint\" button to trigger the Inference Engine.\n3.  **Verify**: Review the model's proposed logic patches. Accept them to commit to the graph.\n4.  **Refine**: Click nodes to manually configure logic or adjust the blueprint spatial layout.\n\n---\n*Built as a behavioral experiment in LLM reasoning stability.*\n",
